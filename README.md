## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

First time I made a page with a dark mode switcher, it turns out that we can make it by switch it on body class and have a set of color pairs for each light and dark version on CSS custom properties.

### Continued development

Looking forward for another challenges with another lessons.
